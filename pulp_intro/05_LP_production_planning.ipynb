    "In a production planning problem, the decision maker must decide how to purchase material, labor, and other resources in order to produce end products to maximize profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, a company named GTC produces wrenches and pliers, subject to the availability of steel, machine capabilities (molding and assembly), labor, and market demand.  \n",
    "GTC would like to determine how much steel to purchase. Complicating the problem is that the available assembly capacity and the product contribution to earnings are unknown presently, but will be known at the beginning of the next period.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this period, GTC must:\n",
    "- determine how much steel to purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the next period, after GTC finds out how much assembly capacity is available and the revenue per unit of wrenches and pliers, GTC will determine\n",
    "- How many wrenches and pliers to produce.\n",
