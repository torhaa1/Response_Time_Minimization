    "- Linear programming is a set of techniques used in mathematical programming, sometimes called mathematical optimization, to solve systems of linear equations and inequalities while maximizing or minimizing some linear function.     \n",
    "- Often, when people try to formulate and solve an optimization problem, the first question is whether they can apply linear programming or mixed-integer linear programming.    \n",

    "#### Terminology\n",
    "**Mixed-integer linear programming** is an extension of linear programming. It handles problems in which at least one variable takes a discrete integer rather than a continuous value. Although mixed-integer problems look similar to continuous variable problems at first sight, they offer significant advantages in terms of flexibility and precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integer variables** are important for properly representing quantities naturally expressed with integers, like the number of airplanes produced or the number of customers served.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary variables** are a particularly important kind of integer variable. It can take only the values zero or one and is useful in making yes-or-no decisions, such as whether a plant should be built or if a machine should be turned on or off. You can also use them to mimic logical constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solvers**, It’s worth mentioning that almost all widely used linear programming and mixed-integer linear programming libraries are native to and written in Fortran or C or C++. This is because linear programming requires computationally intensive work with (often large) matrices. Such libraries are called solvers. The Python tools are just wrappers around the solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several free Python libraries are specialized to interact with linear or mixed-integer linear programming solvers:\n",
    "- SciPy Optimization and Root Finding\n",
    "- PuLP\n",
    "- Pyomo\n",
    "- CVXOPT   \n",
    "\n",
    "Some well-known and very powerful commercial and proprietary solutions are \n",
    "- Gurobi\n",
    "- CPLEX\n",
    "- XPRESS.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides offering flexibility when defining problems and the ability to run various solvers, PuLP is less complicated to use than alternatives like Pyomo or CVXOPT, which require more time and effort to master.    \n",
    "In this tutorial, you’ll use SciPy and PuLP to define and solve linear programming problems."
