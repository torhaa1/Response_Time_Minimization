    "## Speed comparison of Shapely vs PyGeos\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shapely\n",
    "Shapely 2.0 version is a major release featuring a complete refactor of the internals and new vectorized (element-wise) array operations, providing considerable performance improvements (based on the developments in the PyGEOS package)   \n",
    "For more info about the performence upgrades, see the documentation on [Version 2.0.0 (2022-12-12)](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/release/2.x.html#version-2-0-0-2022-12-12)\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyGeos\n",
    "PyGEOS is a Python library that wraps the GEOS library using Ctypes. It provides a high-level interface for the GEOS library, supporting operations on geometries in both vectorized and scalar forms. PyGEOS is designed to be used as a dependency for other Python libraries, such as GeoPandas and Shapely, and is not intended to be used directly by end-users.  \n",
    "For more info about the performence upgrades, see the documentation on [PyGeos](https://pygeos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "\n",
    "PyGEOS can be used as a replacement for Shapely, providing a faster and more efficient implementation of the geometric operations. However it is not fully integrated with GeoPandas yet.  \n",
    "E.g. For GeoDataFrame creation, shapely geometries are accepted with corresponding CRS, while PyGeos geometries are not.  \n",
    "However, one can add PyGeos geometries to a new column in a GeoDataFrame that is empty or containing the valid shapely geometries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compability of Shapely and PyGeos\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapely >2.0 use built-in PyGeos for faster operations.\n",
    "A fresh install of Shapely 2.0 will automatically contain Geos as a dependency.\n",
    "This can be checked by running the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(gpd.options.use_pygeos)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both Shapely and PyGeos are using the same GEOS library, they can conflict over the version of the GEOS library.  \n",
    "When having both Shapely (with GEOS activated) and PyGeos in the same environment, the following warning can be raised:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "UserWarning: The Shapely GEOS version (3.11.3-CAPI-1.17.3) is incompatible with the GEOS version PyGEOS was compiled with (3.10.4-CAPI-1.16.2). Conversions between both will be slow.\n",
    "  compat.set_use_pygeos(value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If this warning is raised, it is true as the warning says: \"Conversions between both will be slow\".  \n",
    "Therefore, it is recommended to deactivate the GEOS library in Shapely and run the code in PyGeos for faster operations.\n",
    "Deactivate the GEOS library in Shapely by running the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gpd.options.use_pygeos = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**OBS: PYGEOS IS DEPRECATED -> MOVE OVER TO SHAPLY 2.0 INSTEAD**\n",
    "\n",
    "Test uninstalling PyGeos and running the code with Shapely 2.0\n"
